# Tree-Climber
You are racing up a tree against another player on another tree, so there is a split screen. To win the game you need to be the first to reach the top and you will also need to collect falling apples to gain extra points. You need to climb from branch to branch while dodging acorns, which are falling and slow you down. The first character is named Tom and the other is a monkey, although both have the same skills and type of controls. One character would be controlled by the arrow keys and the other will be controlled by the A,S,W,D keys. Before the game starts you can decide if you want to do multiplayer or not and if not, then you will be racing for time against your previous best, which would be saved. There will be a “health” score, which is increased by getting apples and decreased when you allow an acorn to hit you. When you finish a race, there will be an option to play again, but on the next level of difficulty, which means that there will be more acorns falling faster, fewer branches to hang onto, and it will be harder to reach the apples. Also, you can change the skin color of the main character or make him a woman (Tomalina) to better represent the player.
